// Comment: Added a simple console log for demonstration
// This is my first code in JavaScript module
console.log("Hello world! \nThis world is beautiful.\nLet's learn JavaScript.");
console.log("JavaScript is fun and powerful!");
const message = "Keep learning and practicing.";
console.log(message);
