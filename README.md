# JavaScript Learning Workspace

This project is a simple JavaScript learning environment. It contains several JS files and an `index.html` file to help you experiment and learn JavaScript concepts.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Node.js
- Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Run JavaScript Files
- You can run any JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) using Node.js in your terminal:
  ```powershell
  node script.js
  ```
- Or, open `index.html` in your browser and press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open the Developer Tools console. You can see the output of your scripts there.

## How to Learn from Each Script
- The `index.html` file includes multiple script tags for different JS files.
- To focus on one script at a time, **comment out** the other `<script>` tags in `index.html`.
- This way, you can learn from each script individually and see its output in the browser console.

## Files in This Project
- `index.html` — Main HTML file to run scripts in the browser
- `script.js`, `func.js`, `logic.js`, `object.js`, `runjs.js` — JavaScript files with different examples

Happy learning!
